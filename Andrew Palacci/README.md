My project for this semester covered the Pigeonhole Principle. I was able to cover what the Pigeonhole and Generalized Pigeonhole principles are, as well as some basic examples. I also made demonstrations in Java that reinforced these two principles and presented them in a more interactive format. Finally, I presented two real-world examples that put the Pigeonhole Principle to use in making an observation about groups of people and in proving that a perfectly lossless compression algorithm is impossible to create. The sources that I used were cited at the end of my presentation, the most notable one being our textbook.
